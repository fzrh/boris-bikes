Boris Bikes
------------

This is a week 3 project whilst learning to code at Makers Academy. The purpose of the project was to learn about Test-Driven Development and Object Oriented Programming.

#### Task
To create a simple system for managing Boris Bikes in London. Our system will keep track of a number of docking stations and the bikes. 
It will allow you to rent the bikes and return them. Occasionally the bikes will break and then they will be unavailable for rental. 
There will also be a garage to fix the bikes and a van to move the bikes between the stations and the garage.

#### Technologies used:
+ RSpec
+ Ruby
